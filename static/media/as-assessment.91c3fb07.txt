56.5: keep learning is religiously for us because we're able to generalize the problem and not have to write
62.1: every single rule rather give the system a bunch of data that says can you learn
78.6: three major sections of how you would going for a and go to the selected for the first overall category is actually good getting a data and losing it I think this is something that's not very exercise
104.3: also looking at how you how do how many

146.4: to figure out how do we set up
147.9: to figure out how do we celebrate the meeting notes
149.4: we want a model to learn what's a good note and the Babies R Us looks like a bunch of see this thing meeting us to how do you collect that the first question
160.5: ask yourself when you go to try
162: to call me wait to do it
166: or find open source data online such
171.5: as from exhaust they're not contain here
174.1: hopefully I'm not getting sick of eyes I think they have
185.1: have over a hundred days. This is it off at 3 and I think the general Industries spending to buy more and more open data so that
192.6: the mountains look up stix el pastor stephen morse thing that is getting the data from your users from you're just a product so if
201.6: every meetings are users are falling out which ones are good with those are bad
207.7: bad then are models able to train and get the hair
211.7: once you figure out what kind of beer do you want to collect how to store and sexy not as straightforward
219.2: straightforward as you would think the first approaches usually using Excel spreadsheets with every rose

233.8: you have 10 or 15 or 20 all the way it's worth putting a little more thought into how can
243.3: i automate the process of storing data
248.4: we look to other databases SQL and kind of industry standard databases for storing
258.9: information about remodeled and then what other options also
263.9: important in this process in the beginning is thinking about how can
267.4: i make sure all my data is this will save you a lot of headaches later down the line
274.5: if you have if you change the way that you're collecting your data over like a month or two
282.6: your model will not be able to distinguish between the different ways that you classified it
287.1: percentage and you're staying on the scale from 0 to 1 and then at is there a task in there
306.2: or if you want to look like how long is it
309.2: or how treatable is it so it's important for your data in the system or not
318.2: that your past it and you can work together
323.2: mini models and still get around that I would say fire size breasts make sure that the store as much
331.3: as you can and you look sexy in a sentence from a user store what user that was for what is a domain what is the topic and as much
345: as you can over like kind of now
347.5: you're set to early because I might be going to play later
351.6: as you can and sexy and the sentence from a user store what user that was for what is a domain what is the topic and as much as you can over like kind of now you're set to early because I might be going to play later
352.1: if you want look at it look like how long is it or how treatable is it's important for your data in the system format so that your past it and you can work together
357.6: i'm so were looking at different databases and be kind of were trying to prioritize your time and reel time and time series on every record that comes in it's easy to go in and it didn't matter too much on which specific one that week
381.3: we the Riu Santa Fe address
389.8: okay so the next step is what you have
391.8: all the state of store do you need
392.8: to make sure that is properly labeled this stuff I think it's probably the most time-consuming stuff out of all these listed here that's
404.9: because it really it might be easy to collect data from your users
410.7: if you're not guaranteeing that they're labeled properly then when you run your model and it's three things
